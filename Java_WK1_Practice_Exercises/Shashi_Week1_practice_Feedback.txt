Feedback:

1)   Instead of import.util.*, please import the specific class. 
E.g import java.util.Scanner;

2) Give meaningful name to variables, methodname and classnames
E.g For variables, instead of giving i,j,x,y you can use "counter" or "count".
E.g String inputtext = sc.next();
E.g public void addNumbers(int num1, int num2)

3)  Exercise : 10
/*10. Write a program for the following condition:
Given 2 inputs , where input1 is string and input 2 is integer value, the last n characters should repeat n number of times in the output String.
Input1:            Stackroute
Input2:            5
Output1:           Stackrouterouterouterouteroute

Input1:            Stackroute
Input2:            2
Output1:           Stackroutetete
